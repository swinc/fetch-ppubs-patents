  briefHtml: '(1) TECHNICAL FIELD<br />(2)  The present invention relates to a picture coding method and a picture decoding method for coding an image digitally so as to transfer or store it.<br />(3) BACKGROUND ART<br />(4)  A coding of moving pictures, in general, divides a picture into a certain size of blocks and performs intra picture prediction and inter picture prediction for each block. It then applies orthogonal transformation, for example, discrete cosine transform or the like for each block of the smallest unit of a division (i.e. 4.times.4 pixels) so as to perform coding using variable length coding based on run level coding for coefficients showing spatial frequency components gained by orthogonal transformation.<br />(5)  The variable length coding assigns variable length code to values of the coefficients contained in the block to which orthogonal transformation is applied (level) as well as to numbers consisting of a series of a coefficient 0 (run). In this case, a table which corresponds the values with variable length code is called a VLC table. Under the conventional method, only one table is prepared as a VLC table respectively for intra prediction coding and inter prediction coding (reference to ISO/IEC 14496-2:1999(E) Information technology--coding of audio-visual objects Part 2: Visual (1999-12-01) P. 119 7.4.1 Variable length decoding).<br />(6)  Under the variable length coding method explained in the existing technique, only one table is prepared as a VLC table respectively for intra prediction coding and inter prediction coding. Therefore, it contains a problem that coding efficiency differs greatly depending on a quality of a current picture to be coded.<br />(7)  In order to solve this problem, a method of preparing a plurality of tables so as to refer to them by switching between them according to the number of coefficients other than 0 contained in a current block to which orthogonal transformation is applied is conceivable. For realizing this, it is necessary to perform coding by applying variable length coding for the numbers of the coefficients other than 0, however, the coding method and the decoding method are not yet established.<br />(8) DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br />(9)  The present invention has been devised in view of these circumstances and it is an object of the present invention to suggest a picture coding method as well as a picture decoding method that realize coding of the number of coefficients other than 0 contained in the block to which orthogonal transformation is applied with high efficiency regardless of the quality of the current picture.<br />(10)  In order to solve the problem as mentioned above, a picture coding method according to the present invention codes, on a block-to-block basis, an image by transforming the image into coefficients showing spatial frequency components and comprises: a predicting step for calculating a predictive value of the number of coefficients other than 0 contained in a current block to be coded based on the numbers of coefficients other than 0 contained in coded blocks located on a periphery of the current block; a table selecting step for selecting tables for variable length coding based on the predictive value calculated in the predicting step; and a variable length coding step for performing variable length coding for the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the current block with reference to the tables for variable length coding selected in the table selecting step.<br />(11)  Thus, it realizes an improvement in coding efficiency since it is possible to refer to optimal tables for variable length coding when coding the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the current block.<br />(12)  Also, in the predicting step, the predictive value is calculated using an average value of the numbers of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the coded blocks.<br />(13)  Also, the tables for variable length coding include at least one VLC table. In the table selecting step, the VLC table is selected based on the predictive value calculated in the predicting step and in the variable length coding step, the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the current block is transformed into a variable length code with reference to the VLC table selected in the table selecting step.<br />(14)  The tables for variable length coding include at least one code table and one VLC table. In the table selecting step, a code table and a VLC table are selected based on the predictive value calculated in the predicting step and in the variable length coding step, the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the current block is transformed into a code number with reference to the code table selected in the table selecting step and then the code number is transformed into a variable length code with reference to the VLC table selected in the table selecting step.<br />(15)  The picture coding method comprises a keeping step for keeping the numbers of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the coded blocks neighboring an uncoded block at least until the uncoded block is coded.<br />(16)  In the predicting step, the predictive value of the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the current block is calculated based on the numbers of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the coded blocks located above and on the left of the current block.<br />(17)  In the predicting step, a value 0 is set as the predictive value when no coded blocks are found above and on the left of the current block.<br />(18)  In the predicting step, an average value of the numbers of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the coded blocks located above and on the left of the current block is calculated as the predictive value when the coded blocks are found above and on the left of the current block.<br />(19)  In the predicting step, the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the coded block on the left of the current block is set as the predictive value when the coded block is found on the left but not above the current block.<br />(20)  In the predicting step, the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the coded block above the current block is set as the predictive value when the coded block is found above but not on the left of the current block.<br />(21)  In the predicting step, a value 0 is set as the predictive value when upper and left boundaries of the current block are either a boundary of pictures, each of which is a unit of the picture or a boundary of slices, each of which is what the picture is divided into a plurality of sections.<br />(22)  In the predicting step, an average value of the numbers of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the coded blocks located above and on the left of the current block is set as the predictive value when upper and left boundaries of the current block are neither a boundary of pictures, each of which is a unit of the picture nor a boundary of slices, each of which is what the picture is divided into a plurality of sections.<br />(23)  In the predicting step, the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the coded block on the left of the current block is set as the predictive value when an upper boundary of the current block is either a boundary of pictures, each of which is a unit of the picture or a boundary of slices, each of which is what the picture is divided into a plurality of sections, and the left boundary is neither the boundary of pictures nor the boundary of slices.<br />(24)  In the predicting step, the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the coded block above the current block is set as the predictive value when a left boundary of the current block is either a boundary of pictures, each of which is a unit of the picture or a boundary of slices, each of which is what the picture is divided into a plurality of sections, and an upper boundary is neither the boundary of pictures nor the boundary of slices.<br />(25)  A picture decoding method according to the present invention decodes, on a block-to-block basis, an image that is coded by transforming the image into coefficients showing spatial frequency components and comprises:<br />(26)  a predicting step for calculating a predictive value of the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in a current block to be decoded based on numbers of coefficients other than 0 contained in decoded blocks located on a periphery of the current block;<br />(27)  a table selecting step for selecting tables for variable length decoding based on the predictive value calculated in the predicting step; and a variable length decoding step for performing variable length decoding for the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the current block with reference to the tables for variable length decoding selected in the table selecting step.<br />(28)  Thus, it realizes a correct decoding of a bit stream, in which the number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the block is coded, referring to optimal tables for variable length decoding.<br />(29)  Also, in the predicting step, the predictive value is calculated using an average value of the numbers of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the decoded blocks.<br />(30)  Also, the tables for variable length decoding include at least one VLC table. In the table selecting step, the VLC table is selected based on the predictive value calculated in the predicting step, and in the variable length decoding step, a variable length code showing the number of coefficients other than 0 contained in the current block is transformed into said number of the coefficients other than 0 contained in the current block, with reference to the VLC table selected in the table selecting step.<br />(31)  The tables for variable length decoding include at least one code table and one VLC table.
